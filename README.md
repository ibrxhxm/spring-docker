# Spring Boot + Docker practice
- This is an employee management system built using Spring boot and PostgreSQL running in a docker container. 
- You can find the docker image to this project [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/ibrxhxm/app-spring-docker)

- Before running the docker image make sure that theres no app listening on port 7777 of your host. ✌🏾
